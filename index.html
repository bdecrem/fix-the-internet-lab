			<h1>Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet Spring Lab</h1>
			<p>Whether it’s misinformation, surveillance, shutdowns, centralized platforms + AI algorithms or hateful bots, today’s internet has veered from its FULL potential. Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet Lab is an incubator-styled program to mobilize + fund products + technologies that enables everyone to connect, build a better society + economy.</p>
			<p>Do you and your friends have an idea for how to make things better? <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqUVWii7mHswssQCMFhmOWfSSHWaMxqakMdiPEhyxkd8bp_w/viewform">Apply now</a></strong> for our Spring Lab, or we can keep you up-to-date on all the details for the Summer Startup Studio.</p>
			<p>For the Spring Lab, we are looking for ideas in the following areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Collaboration &amp; society:</strong> in these unique times, we are especially interested in ideas that foster better collaboration online, but also neighborhood support networks and supporting small businesses.</li>
				<li><strong>Distributed web:</strong> using the blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies to build the next generation of the web.</li>
				<li><strong>Messaging &amp; social networking:</strong> can we build the next IG or TikTok, but on stronger foundations?</li>
				<li><strong>Misinformation &amp; content:</strong> ideas for apps &amp; services that help us get beyond polarization, filter bubbles and fake news.</li>
				<li><strong>Surveillance capitalism:</strong> whether it’s Big Tech or governments, everyone’s collecting your data. How do we put the user back in control of their data?</li>
				<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> put to work to benefit consumers and citizens, not just big tech.</li>
			</ul>
